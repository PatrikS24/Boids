This is my implementation of boids. Boids are agents that move in a birdlike fasion by following a few simple rules; separation, alignment, and cohesion. I read the documentation at https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/labs/s2021/Boids/Boids.html#:~:text=Boids%20is%20an%20artificial%20life,very%20simple%20set%20of%20rules.
as inspiration for how the boids should work. I also implemented a feature that makes it so that the boids can follow or avoid the users mouse.
